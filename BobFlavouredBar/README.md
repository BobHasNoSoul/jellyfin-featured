put the content of bobflabouredbar into your webroot for easy no fuss installation

copy the contents of avatars/custom.css to your customcss in admin panel and boom done.

it automatically grabs things from your api to display in the absence of the list.txt 

it loads fast.. like really fast, shuffles list.txt on every load, it also does the shuffle for the random items it pulls from the api if you wish.

styled to be more my liking hence the new folder to contain my version (im welcoming other peoples designs etc too so if you have a custom version just submit a pull request and i will allow it for the most part if it can be inside its own webroot style folder that is best)

thanks for reading
